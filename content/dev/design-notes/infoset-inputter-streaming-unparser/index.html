<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Daffodil Runtime 1 keeps track of the nest of dynamic context terms at runtime on a stack which
is maintained by the Unparsers.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="schema-compilation">Schema Compilation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At schema compilation time, we compute, for each Term, the set of possible next
elements that can follow it, but only as far as the end of the <em>lexically
enclosing</em> model group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is done in the possibleNextLexicalSiblingElementsInInfoset member of
the Term class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From this information, we compute a element resolver that handles only this
partial resolution, which is an instance of class PartialNextElementResolver.
This is associated with every Term and carried fro runtime on the TermRuntimeData
objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is done in the partialNextElementResolver member of the TermRuntime1Mixin,
as the PartialNextElementResolver is a Runtime 1 data structure/object.
This object is serialized as part of the TermRuntimeData.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fact that this is computed using only information going out to the end of the
single lexically enclosing model-group avoids a combinatorial
explosion in the schema compiler.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="unparser-runtime">Unparser Runtime</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At runtime for the Unparser, element resolving is done by the InfosetInputter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Complete/total element name resolution is done by combining the partial
next element resolvers from the dynamic nest of terms.
This is done with a stack in the UState.
Specifically, the stack, called <code>trdStack</code> is state of the InfosetInputter.
Unparsers are burdened with having to push/pop TermRuntimeData objects to maintain this stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The algorithm which iterates down the stack entries to carry out a next element
resolution for the InfosetInputter, is carried on the NextElementResolver trait,
which is mixed into the InfosetInputter trait, so is shared by all InfosetInputter
derived classes.
Note that no state is shared.
The stack is private to a given instance of an InfosetInputter class,
so is private per-thread state just like the rest of the UState.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This design incurs runtime overhead to push/pop TRDs on the stack,
and next element resolution is no longer just a single hash-table lookup, but
potentially an iteration through multiple such lookups.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="schema-compiler-support-for-dynamic-context-stack">Schema Compiler Support for Dynamic Context Stack</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we focus in on just Term, ModelGroup, and ElementBase.
The diagram below shows the Term class, with the possibleNextLexicalSiblingElementsInInfoset
member.
All Terms have as a member their (1-based) position within the enclosing
lexical model group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The set of possible elements that can follow a given Term can be closed,
as when a required element is found downstream. If all downstream elements
in the enclosing lexical model group are optional, then the set of possible
elements is open ended. The Open/Closed status of the list is
signified by a PossibleNextElements case class object correspondingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One final detail is that when compiling the set of possible next elements for
a choice, there can be elements on branches that are required, but in
the context of that choice, if any branch has all optional content, then
all the possible next elements for all branches are optional.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Term itself, if it is an ElementBase, has a isRequiredInInfoset member, which is determined
based on properties.
When combined in a choice, we need a way to override
this, and we encapsulate the ElementBase in a Sibling case class object which
carries its own isRequiredInInfoset member which can be set to false to
override the underlying ElementBase&#8217;s isRequiredInInfoset due to that
corresponding element appearing in a choice branch.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The set of possible subsequent ElementBase objects that can
follow another is computed inductively starting from the last element
or group within a sequence.
It is limited to the length of the current sequence, since sequences can be
shared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Note that unshared i.e., local sequences could in principle be
special cased - collapsed together - for purposes of this analysis.
We assume here that we will treat all sequence groups as if they were
shared via group refs.)</p>

<h3 id="runtime-support-for-dynamic-context-stack">Runtime Support for Dynamic Context Stack</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below we show the runtime 1 objects that implement the next element resolution
for the streaming unparser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Unparser has a UState, which has an InfosetInputter.
The InfosetInputter trait mixes in the implementation of NextElementResolver
which provides the push/pop API for maintaining the TRD stack, and it
provides the nextElement method which does complete next element resolving, chaining
through the PartialNextElementResolvers obtained from the stack of TRDs.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any given PartialNextElementResolver can resolve a name (+ namespace when used)
to an ERD, or it can not be able to perform the resolution, which is not
an error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a whole the next-element resoluiton algorithm requires that the unparser
maintain the stack of TermRuntimeData objects and the resolution
algorithm works down the stack using the partial resolver from the most-
recently pushed runtime data object first.
If that does not resolve the element it either fails - because the partial
resolver knows that the incoming element event <strong>must</strong> be one of the possibilities
it represents (Closed set of possibles), or it moves to the next deeper runtime-data
object on the stack having a partial next element resolver (for Open set of possibles),
and tries that.
This continues until it succeeds, or until an ERD is found on the stack, at
which point the resolution fails and an unparse error (fatal) is issued.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the context of next-element-resolution cannot span the boundary of a
complex element.
This is because an end-element event must be received before any subsequent
element start events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This dynamic-context TRD stack need not be copied to UStates for Suspensions as
those only occur after Infoset elements have been created.</p>

<p>The dashed lines from ModelGroup are to illustrate that some ModelGroup classes
inherit from GroupDefLike, as they define lexically, a surround of their group
members.
Other ModelGroup classes inherit GroupRef (SequenceGroupRef and ChoiceGroupRef)
which share the group definition.
Ignoring the Root element for a moment, every Term has a lexically enclosing
ModelGroup which inherits from GroupDefLike. This is the mechanism by which
ModelGroups and their contents can be shared in multiple distinct contexts.</p>

<p>The code design is somewhat simpler in that prior code has two different kinds of

get the next element ERD.
This lookup hash table is encapsulated in the NextElementResolver classes.
At schema compile time, given each element ERD, it is precomputed what the
possible valid set of subsequent following ERDs can be (including the current
one again, in case of an array).
This set of possibilities is captured in an instance of the NextElementResolver
 class, and is stored on each ERD.</p>

<p>This process makes unparsing a self-validating kind of processing.
As an external representation of the Infoset is converted into an
actual stream of Infoset events, each incoming element event is
scrutinized against the schema for whether it is allowed.
This scrutiny is built into the fact that the incoming element
name+namespace is being looked up in the NextElementResolver, and then
once each element is created, a new NextElementResolver object is
taken from its ERD for the next infoset event lookup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An invariant (which remains true in current behavior and in proposed new
changes) is that the next element resolution process cannot cross a complex
-type element boundary, as an end-element event ends the scope of the possible
legal subsequent elements that can arrive next.
However, within a complex type, there can be many groups and group references.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This architecture depends on the fact that the ElementRuntimeData (ERD) objects
are unique per element, and per element context - that is, they are depending
on the fact that element ERDs are not shared and so they uniquely identify both
the element, and the context of that element (nest of all enclosing groups).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of the changes to fix our schema compiler speed/space issues
(DAFFODIL-1444), this assumption is no longer valid.
Elements (specifically DSOM ElementBase objects) can be shared. Groups
can be shared.
The expected improvement in schema compiler performance and the space
reduction is fundamentally driven from this sharing.
This sharing is also needed to implement a desirable future feature
which is to enable recursive definitions in DFDL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, the required change is from one where an ERD is a unique
identifier of an element and all its dynamic context, to one where
because ERDs are shared, the Unparser runtime must maintain a stack of
the dynamic context information sufficient to perform next-element
resolution as each infoset event must be synthesized.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of changes to <em>eventually</em> improve schema compiler space and speed usage,
(DAFFODIL-1444) we introduced sharing information to the DSOM objects in the schema.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sharing information is present - every global schema component
object can examine every context in the schema from which it is shared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This unfortunately creates a situation where we get a combinatorial explosion
of computation.
The sharable objects, such as a group definition, are still today NOT being
shared, they are being copied.
Yet within each copy, each element in it behaves as if it was being shared.
So, for example, if you ask the last element of a group definition what possible
elements can follow it, it responds with a list of every element that can
follow for every context where the group is referenced.
What&#8217;s worse, this same thing is calculated repeatedly since the sharable
group is, in fact, not being shared currently so there are many copies of
this final element to do this computation on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result is something which grows in algorithmic complexity very fast.
If you have a very small schema or wait long enough, then compilation of the
schema should complete and be correct.
Hence, most all small tests work fine.
Larger schemas fail to finish compiling in any reasonable amount of time or
memory space.</p>

                        at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly
                        accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision
                        making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
                        status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that
                        the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
