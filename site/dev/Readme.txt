The dev folder is for developer documentation on Daffodil.

Apache project conventions are commonly for content to be divided with user
documentation on the project web site, and developer documentation on the
Wiki.

However, we have found the confluence wiki to be brittle, and doesn't maintain
pages in diff-able source-code-like style, so are creating developer
documentation also on the project site, using AsciiDoc pages.
