<h2 id="build-the-apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code-and-run-it-as-a-developer">Build the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code and Run It as a Developer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clone the project <a href="https://github.com/apache/daffodil-vscode.git">https://github.com/apache/daffodil-vscode.git</a></li>
<li>Open the project folder in VS Code.</li>
<li>Run <code>yarn</code> to update the local dependencies.</li>
<li>Press <code>F5</code> (or launch “Extension” under the “Run and Debug” pane) to build and launch the extension in another VS Code window.</li>
<li>In that newly loaded window, named “sampleWorkspace”, you can then debug schema files using the local version of the extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>The local Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code downloads and caches the Apache Daffodil™ Debugger corresponding to the latest extension release. If you want to test a <em>local</em> version of the Apache Daffodil Debugger, you need to: * add <code>"useExistingServer": true</code> to the configuration in your <code>launch.json</code> in the sample workspace; * launch the backend debugger locally, using a launch configuration like below: <code>json     {       "type": "scala",       "name": "DAPodil",       "request": "launch",       "mainClass": "org.apache.daffodil.debugger.dap.DAPodil",       "args": []     }</code> This will start the debug adapter and await a connection from the Apache Daffodil VS Code Extension (usually on TCP port 4711); and * debug your schema file, as long as it has the <code>useExistingServer</code> setting above.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-automated-test-suite">Running the Automated Test Suite</h2>
<p>The Apache Daffodil VS Code Extension comes with an automated test suite. Run it as follows:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>yarn test</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-against-a-specific-version-of-vs-code">Testing Against a Specific Version of VS Code</h3>
<p>By default, the test suite will use the earliest supported release of VS Code. To test against any <em>specific</em> version of VS Code (in this example, VS Code version 1.74.3), execute the test suite as follows, setting <code>DAFFODIL_TEST_VSCODE_VERSION</code> to the desired version:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>DAFFODIL_TEST_VSCODE_VERSION=1.74.3 yarn test</code></pre>
<p>Set <code>DAFFODIL_TEST_VSCODE_VERSION</code> to <code>stable</code> to use the latest stable release, or to <code>insiders</code> to use the latest (nightly) insiders build.</p>
<h3 id="tls-certificate-issues">TLS Certificate Issues</h3>
<p>HTTPS TLS certificates are verified by default. When running the test suite in certain environments (e.g., company VPN that uses endpoint protection), TLS certificate verifications may fail with a self-signed certificate error. If this is the case, either have node trust the endpoint protection certificate, or use one of these workarounds to disable the certificate verification:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 yarn test</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>node ./out/tests/runTest.js --disable_cert_verification</code></pre>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not <code>export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0</code> into your environment as it will disable TLS certificate verification on <em>all</em> node HTTPS connections done in that shell session.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-documentation">Building the Documentation</h2>
<p>To build <code>docx</code> (Word formatted) documentation, from the top of the cloned repository, run:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>cd docs &amp;&amp; make all</code></pre>
<h2 id="reviewing-and-verifying-dependency-bot-updates">Reviewing and Verifying Dependency Bot Updates</h2>
<p>For GitHub CI action updates (pull requests that start with <strong>Bump actions/…</strong>), make sure the affected workflows still operate as expected (they are automatically CI tested). GitHub CI actions update workflow YAML files, and are part of the CI infrastructure and not a code dependency. These should be relatively quick and easy to assess compared to code dependencies.</p>
<p>If the updates are not GitHub CI action updates, then additional scrutiny is required. When reviewing and verifying dependency bot updates that are part the software supply chain being distributed, please use the following checklist:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
<strong>Do all automated continuous integration checks pass?</strong></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
<strong>Is the update a patch, minor, or major update?</strong></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
<strong>Is the license still compatible with ASF License Policy?</strong></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
<strong>Have any changes been made to LICENSE/NOTICE files that need to be incorporated?</strong></li>

<h1 id="apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code-roadmap">Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code: Roadmap</h1>
<p>Now that the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code version 1.0.0 has been released and published on the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode">Microsoft® VS Code Marketplace</a>, it is time to consider features and improvements for the next major releases.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="important-ideas-on-the-future-of-the-apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code">Important Ideas on the Future of the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>While version 1.0.0 of the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code focused on the schema and the infoset, the theme of the next version will place additional emphasis on the input data. The input data could be any kind of file, with different byte sizes, byte ordering, and alignments, so having robust hex editing capabilities is important.</p>
<p>It is also important to have the ability to set breakpoints not only in the schema, but also <em>in the data</em>, and allow for manipulating the data and watch it affect the parse outcome. In other words, what happens to the parse when the data changes in some way. While stepping through the debugger, the schema, the infoset, and the data views need to be kept in sync.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="desired-features-of-the-input-data-editor">Desired Features of the Input Data Editor</h2>
<p>For organizational purposes, the desired features for the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code are broken down into eight functional areas.</p>
<h3 id="file-type-support-fts">1. File Type Support (FTS)</h3>
<p><strong>1.1 The data editor needs to support any fixed length (non-streaming) file Daffodil is capable of opening.</strong> Generally, any file type can be opened and displayed by a hex editor. The file type and extension do not influence the rendering of the file in hex or binary formats.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface-ui">2. User Interface (UI)</h3>
<p><strong>2.1 The data editor needs to be responsive and provide a good VS Code User Experience.</strong> Existing third-party VS Code hex editors will decrease in responsiveness while rendering medium to large size files. The editor will handle file sizes common to Daffodil without impacting overall usability.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 The data editor needs to be designed as a composition of display panels that allow for multiple data representations to be rendered on the same screen.</strong> A data file may be segmented into multiple representations of data, from differing on byte boundaries to endianness. The editor will render differing representations within the same user interface.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 The data editor needs to allow individual display panels to maintain their own position in the data to allow viewing different segments of data in different display panels.</strong> The editor will manage each composable view as a separate Viewport capable of displaying a view into the data at a specified offset and capacity.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 The data editor viewports need to be interactive to allow mouse and keyboard interactions such as scrolling and context menus.</strong> User interaction will drive the function of the editor as such the ability to interpret keyboard and mouse actions on individual and block data selections are critical.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 The data editor needs to include a Properties View component.</strong> The property view will provide a static region on the display to place file and selection metadata. The property view is not associated to a specific region in the file, so it is not a viewport component. It is tied to events such as selection events and is updated based on notification of events occurring.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 The data editor needs to include a property display mode for a single unit selection.</strong> The Properties View will allow multiple representations for a single unit, eg byte, to be displayed simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 The data editor needs to include a property display mode for multiple unit selection.</strong> Selecting up to some limit of bytes, for example four, could still be rendered in the Properties View. For example, selecting four bytes could render a 32-bit integer value.</p>
<h3 id="persisting-edits-per">3. Persisting Edits (PER)</h3>
<p><strong>3.1 The data editor needs to allow edits to be saved as a new file.</strong> The editor will not attempt to write the file that is held open by Daffodil. Instead, a copy of the file will be written to disk.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 The data editor needs to provide an auto-incremented file revision number to save without prompting the user.</strong> When saving edits to a file it may be preferrable for the save-as-new-file to be transparent to the user. In this case the user will not be prompted for a file name but instead use an autogenerated name.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 The data editor needs to provide a save-as option to name a new file.</strong> When saving edits to a file the user may want to specify where the edited file will be saved. In this case a file picker dialog or something similar can be used to allow the user to specify the location for the save file.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 The data editor will provide a convenient way of restarting the Daffodil debugger with the specified edits.</strong> After saving the edits to a file the debugger can be restarted and automatically set to use the new files path as the input. This convenience allows the user to avoid editing their launch profile to point to the new file.</p>
<h3 id="data-representations-datarep">4. Data Representations (DATAREP)</h3>
<p>Hex and binary representations for both viewing and editing.</p>
<p><strong>4.1 The data editor needs to implement support for multiple data representations.</strong> The editor will use the viewport component design to deliver a composable multiple representation rendering capability.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 The data editor needs to provide a viewport for viewing byte delimited data.</strong> The viewport will display hex bytes similar to the common hex editor displayed.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 The data editor needs to provide a viewport for viewing data as individual bits.</strong> The viewport will render binary 1-0 display. The details of the rendering such as unit length can be modified using properties associated with the viewport.</p>
<p><strong>4.4 The data editor needs to provide configurable rendering properties for any given representation.</strong> The UI will allow the user to view and edit viewport properties</p>
<p><strong>4.5 The data editor needs to provide configurable endianness properties for viewport rendering.</strong> Configuring big or little endian for a viewport.</p>
<p><strong>4.6 Ability to represent data where MSB or LSB bit can be the first bit displayed.</strong> Ability to view and edit bytes represented in binary where the most significant bit can be the first bit of the byte, or the last bit of the byte.</p>
<h3 id="editing-edt">5. Editing (EDT)</h3>
<p><strong>5.1 The data editor needs to implement inline editing within a viewport.</strong> The viewport will support mouse and keyboard interaction to initiate editing a value.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 The data editor needs to default to editing in the same representation as the view.</strong> The editor will allow editing using the same viewport rendering as the representation, e.g., hex from hex, binary from binary can be represented using the native rendering logic of the viewport.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 The data editor needs to provide undo / redo capability related to edits.</strong> A common expectation of editors such as this would be to provide commands to undo and redo edits that have been made.</p>
<p><strong>5.4 The data editor needs to provide editing in differing representations as the view.</strong> The editor could provide something similar to a pop-out component that allows editing a value in a format that differs from the viewport representation, e.g., editing binary from the hex view.</p>
<h3 id="debugger-integration-dbg">6. Debugger integration (DBG)</h3>
<p><strong>6.1 The debugger needs to provide extension points which allow executing debug commands from the editor.</strong> There are certain non-standard operations such as setting breakpoints on data locations that are to be supported. This will require the debugger to provide extension points that allow the editor to pass instructions that augment the debugger flow.</p>
<p><strong>6.2 The debugger will support breakpoints to be set at data positions in the input file.</strong> Setting breakpoints on data locations indicates to the debugger that when the input stream reaches a specified point in the file it will break execution as if it hit a code breakpoint.</p>
<p><strong>6.3 The data editor will allow breakpoints to be set at data positions in the input file.</strong> The data editor will allow creation of and then render data breakpoints in a similar way to how code breakpoints are set and rendered.</p>
<p><strong>6.4 The data editor will support starting debug from a specified position.</strong> The editor provides a function via a context menu that indicates a starting point in the file for the input stream. This will drop all bytes prior to this location when starting the debug.</p>
<p><strong>6.5 The data editor will support stopping debug at a specified position.</strong> The editor provides a function via a context menu that indicates the stopping point in the input stream. All data after this point will be ignored by the input stream, ending the debug at the specified point.</p>
<p><strong>6.6 The debugger will support the latest version of Apache Daffodil™ released.</strong> The extension will be kept up to date with the latest version of Apache Daffodil™.</p>
<h3 id="editing-commands-cmd">7. Editing Commands (CMD)</h3>
<p>In this section a “block” is defined as a range that has been selected by the user.</p>
<p><strong>7.1 The data editor needs to support adding individual bytes.</strong> The editor will provide a function to insert a single byte at a position in the file.</p>
<p><strong>7.2 The data editor needs to support adding blocks of bytes.</strong> The editor will provide a function to insert multiple bytes starting at a position in the file.</p>
<p><strong>7.3 The data editor needs to support deleting individual bytes.</strong> The editor will provide a function to delete a single byte from the file.</p>
<p><strong>7.4 The data editor needs to support deleting blocks of bytes.</strong> The editor will provide a function to delete blocks of bytes from the file.</p>
<p><strong>7.5 The data editor needs to support modifying the value of an individual byte.</strong> The editor will provide a function to overwrite the value of a byte in the file.</p>
<p><strong>7.6 The data editor needs to support modifying the value of a block of bytes.</strong> The editor will provide a function to overwrite the value of a block of bytes in the file.</p>
<p><strong>7.7 The data editor needs to support copying byte(s).</strong> The editor will provide the ability to select and copy a range of bytes to the clipboard for convenience and interoperability. The size of bytes that can be copied will need an upper limit depending on the file size and system memory availability.</p>
<p><strong>7.8 The data editor needs to support pasting byte(s).</strong> The editor will provide the ability to past bytes from the system clipboard into the file at a specified position for convenience and interoperability.</p>
<p><strong>7.9 The data editor needs to support searching for patterns</strong>. The editor will provide a search function similar to a text editor find text using literal text. This pattern would literally be searched for in each given representation.</p>
<p><strong>7.10 The data editor needs to support replacing search results with new patterns.</strong> The editor will provide a search function similar to a text editor find text using literal text and replace the found text with alternate text. This pattern would literally be searched for in each given representation and replaced using text that is valid within said representation.</p>
<p><strong>7.11 The data editor needs to use the native clipboard provided by the operating system for interoperability with other applications.</strong> The editor will use the operating system clipboard for copy and paste operations to improve interoperability with other applications.</p>
<p><strong>7.12 The data editor needs to support applying a bit mask to an individual byte.</strong> The editor will provide function to apply a mask to a byte at a position in the file.</p>
<p><strong>7.13 The data editor needs to support applying a bit mask to a block of bytes.</strong> The editor will provide a function to apply a mask to a selection of bytes in the file.</p>
<h3 id="test-data-markup-language-integration-tdml">8. Test Data Markup Language integration (TDML)</h3>
<p><strong>8.1 All external files needed by the TDML file will be incorporated as relative paths into the TDML file.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8.2 TDML features need to be as modular as possible.</strong> Modularization allows for the future removal of TDML from the repository of the DFDL extension and addition to a library that can be shared by the DFDL repository.</p>
<p><strong>8.3 TDML features need to be written in Scala and will read/write XML by using XML bindings (e.g., Jaxb/scalaxb).</strong></p>
<p><strong>8.4 The extension needs to provide an item in the command palette (ctrl + shift + p) for ‘Generate TDML File’.</strong></p>
<p>Selecting this command will display menus allowing the user to select the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>TDML File Name</li>
<li>Name for the test case</li>
<li>Description for the test case</li>
<li>DFDL Schema</li>
<li>Data Document</li>
</ul>
<p>This selection will work in the same way as the DFDL debugger. If the user selects the command from a DFDL Schema, it will automatically use that in place of a selection.</p>
<ul>
<li>The TDML File will be created in the workspace directory.</li>
<li>The DFDL Schema and Document files will be file names only.</li>
<li>These file names will be relative to the workspace directory. It will be the responsibility of the user to organize everything when creating a TDML file and to package the files up for distribution.</li>
<li>The name of the TDML file will be the name of the DFDL schema used with ‘.tdml’ appended to the end.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8.5 The extension needs to provide an item in the command palette (ctrl + shift + p) for ‘Add Test Case to TDML File’.</strong></p>
<p>Selecting this command will display menus allowing the user to select the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>TDML File Name</li>
<li>Name for the test case</li>
<li>Description for the test case</li>
<li>DFDL Schema</li>
<li>Data Document</li>
</ul>
<p>This selection will work in the same way as the DFDL debugger. If the user selects the command from a DFDL Schema, it will automatically use that in place of a selection.</p>
<p><strong>8.6 The extension needs to provide an item in the command palette (ctrl + shift + p) for ‘Run Test Case in TDML File’.</strong></p>
<p>Selecting this command will display menus allowing the user to select the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>TDML File Name</li>
<li>Test Case to run (this list will be populated with data in the selected TDML File)</li>
</ul>
<p>This command will start the Daffodil process in run mode. This command will provide an option to start the Daffodil process in debug mode. The location of the DFDL Schema is expected to be relative to the location of the TDML File. It will be the responsibility of the user who created the TDML file to ensure that packaging of their TDML file is correct.</p>
<h3 id="intellisense-auto-completion-int">IntelliSense Auto Completion (INT)</h3>
<p><strong>9.1 The extension needs to provide context sensitive auto completion suggestion (IntelliSense) based on the DFDL language.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.2 The IntelliSense suggestions for attributes needs to supply an appropriate list of choices where applicable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.3 The IntelliSense for element tags needs to supply attribute appropriate for that specific tag.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.4 The IntelliSense for element tags needs to supply attribute suggestions for newly insert tags as well as editing existing tags.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.5 The IntelliSense needs to supply suggestions based on the contextual cursor position.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.6 The IntelliSense suggestions need to work when multiple tags are on a single line as well as when each tag is on a single line.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.7 IntelliSense needs to supply a closing tag when a closing tag is missing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.8 IntelliSense suggestions need to work when attributes are split on multiple lines.</strong></p>
<h3 id="dfdl-schema-syntax-colorization-syn">DFDL Schema Syntax Colorization (SYN)</h3>
<p><strong>10.1 Provide DFDL syntax colorization.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10.2 Matching tags within the dfdl schema need to be highlighted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10.3 XPath expressions embedded within dfdl schema should be highlighted.</strong></p>

<h1 id="apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code">Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code</h1>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code is an extension to the Microsoft® Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor which enables Data Format Description Language (DFDL) syntax highlighting, code completion, and the interactive debugging of DFDL Schema parsing operations using <a href="https://daffodil.apache.org/">Apache Daffodil™</a>.</p>
<p>DFDL is a data modeling language used to describe file formats. The DFDL language is a subset of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Schema Definition (XSD). Just as file formats are rich and complex, so is the modeling language to describe them. Developing DFDL Schemas can be challenging, requiring a lot of iterative development, and testing.</p>
<p>The purpose of Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code is to ease the burden on DFDL Schema developers, enabling them to develop high quality, DFDL Schemas, in less time. VS Code is free, open source, cross-platform, well-maintained, extensible, and ubiquitous in the developer community. These attributes align well with the Apache Daffodil™ project and the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code.</p>
<h2 id="bundled-tools-in-the-apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code">Bundled Tools in the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code</h2>
<h3 id="dfdl-syntax-highlighting">DFDL Syntax Highlighting</h3>
<p>DFDL is rich and complex. Developers using modern code editors expect some degree of built-in language support for the language in which they are developing, and DFDL should be no different. The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides syntax highlighting to improve the readability and context of the text. In addition, the syntax highlighting provides feedback to the developer indicating the structure and code appear syntactically correct.</p>
<h3 id="dfdl-schema-code-completion">DFDL Schema Code Completion</h3>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides code completion, also known as “Intellisense”, offering context-aware code segment predictions that can dramatically speed up DFDL Schema development by reducing keyboard input, memorization by the developer, and typos.</p>
<h3 id="daffodil-data-parse-debugger">Daffodil Data Parse Debugger</h3>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides a Daffodil Data Parse Debugger which enables the developer to carefully control the execution of Apache Daffodil™ parse operations. Given a DFDL Schema and a target data file, the developer can step through the execution of a parse line by line, or until the parse reaches some developer-defined location, known as a break point, in the DFDL Schema. What is particularly helpful is that the developer can watch the parsed output, known as the “infoset”, as it’s being created by the parser, and see where the parser is parsing in the data file. This enables the developer to quickly discover and correct issues, improving DFDL Schema development and testing cycles.</p>
<h3 id="data-editor">Data Editor</h3>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides an integrated data editor as a new <em>experimental</em> feature that is currently under development. It is akin to a hex editor, but tuned specifically for challenging Daffodil use cases. It is designed to support virtually any sized file, well beyond the limits of the standard text editor in VS Code, and it can handle non-text data just as well as text data. It has support for setting Daffodil debugger breakpoints on offset positions <em>in the data file</em> in addition to the positions in the DFDL Schema. It handles non-standard byte sizes, non-aligned bytes, and byte ordering where the Least Significant Byte (LSB) can be the first or last bit in a byte. As an editor designed for Daffodil developers by Daffodil developers, features of the tool will evolve quickly to address the specific needs of the Daffodil community.</p>

<h2 id="option-1-install-the-apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code-from-the-visual-studio-code-extension-marketplace">Option 1: Install the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code From the Visual Studio Code Extension Marketplace</h2>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code is available in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode">Visual Studio Code Extension Marketplace</a>.</p>
<h2 id="option-2-install-the-latest-.vsix-file-from-the-apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code-release-page">Option 2: Install the Latest .Vsix File From the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code Release Page</h2>
<p>The latest <code>.vsix</code> (the file extension used for VS Code extensions) file can also be downloaded from the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code <a href="https://github.com/apache/daffodil-vscode/releases">releases page</a> and installed by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the command-line via <code>code --install-extension &lt;path-to-downloaded-vsix-file&gt;</code>; or</li>
<li>Using the “Extensions: Install from VSIX” command from within VS Code by opening the Command Palette (Mac = Command+Shift+P, Windows/Linux = Ctrl+Shift+P), and typing <code>vsix</code> to bring up the command and pointing it at the downloaded <code>.vsix</code> file, as demonstrated in the following animation.</li>

<h1 id="dfdl-schema-authoring-using-code-completion">DFDL Schema Authoring Using Code Completion</h1>
<h2 id="set-the-editor-to-dfdl-mode">Set the Editor to “dfdl” mode</h2>
<p>Since DFDL Schema files end with <code>.xsd</code> (XML Schema Definition or XSD), the editor needs to be informed specifically that DFDL mode is desired over the more general XML mode, the following animation demonstrates how to set the desired mode for DFDL.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98881959/152995118-e2da5835-027e-4ff7-90f9-baf36a7e04bb.gif" /></p>
<h2 id="dfdl-schema-authoring-features">DFDL Schema Authoring Features</h2>
<p>Auto suggest is triggered using control space or typing the beginning characters of an item, as demonstrated in the following animation.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98881959/152995218-65d5b5b6-b610-495d-af31-69dd81be58c1.gif" /></p>
<p>📝 <strong>NOTE:</strong> Intellisense is <em>context aware</em>, so there is no need to begin a block with <code>&lt;</code>, just start typing the tag name and code completion will automatically handle it as appropriate.</p>
<p>Typing one or more unique characters will further limit the results, as demonstrated in the following animation.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98881959/152995254-1de6d39e-a482-4cb5-b7f3-7444932d056f.gif" /></p>
<p>Code completion can be used to add the schema block, with just a couple of keystrokes, as demonstrated in the following animation.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98881959/152995294-7d70b7c6-186b-41e1-8a48-81ebfc3e04bc.gif" /></p>
<p>Code completion can make short work out of completing a DFDL Format Block, offering context-sensitive suggestions for the format attribute values, as demonstrated in the following animation.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98881959/152995321-ef0b2d45-32e6-4e3a-b5aa-859aa937cc3a.gif" /></p>
<p>The <code>&gt;</code> or <code>/</code> characters are used to close XML tags. Use <code>tab</code> to select an item from the drop down and to exit double quotes, as demonstrated in the following animation.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98881959/152995446-77a33620-7277-4d9a-8dd7-f88349299ec9.gif" /></p>
<p>Code completion supports creating self-defined <code>dfdl:complextypes</code> and <code>dfdl:simpleTypes</code>, as demonstrated in the following animation.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98881959/152995652-e56bc55d-78ba-46f6-a26c-6d7bd4440e96.gif" /></p>
<p>The <code>tab</code> key can be used to complete an auto-complete item within an XML tag. After auto-complete is triggered, typing the initial character or characters will limit the suggestion results. Inside an XML tag a <code>space</code> or <code>carriage return</code> will trigger a list of context sensitive attribute suggestions, as demonstrated in the following animation.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98881959/152995682-466be4bb-7f3f-4dcc-84bc-09792bc26adc.gif" /></p>

<h2 id="known-issues-with-code-completion">Known Issues With Code Completion</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code uses a clunky method to auto complete curly braces within quotes. It is anticipated that this will be better addressed in the future. The auto complete method blocks suggestions while typing between the beginning quote, opening curly brace and the closing curly brace, ending quote.</li>

<h2 id="debug-configuration">Debug Configuration</h2>
<p>Debugging a DFDL Schema needs both the DFDL Schema to use and a data file to parse. Instead of having to select the DFDL Schema and the data file each time from a file picker, a “launch configuration” can be created, which is a JSON description of the debugging session.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1545372/130598508-ed4ac8df-ec93-4f45-8ef8-d2668234aff6.gif" /></p>
<p>To create the launch profile:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Select <code>Run -&gt; Open Configurations</code> from the VS Code menubar. This will load a <code>launch.json</code> file into the editor. There may be existing <code>configurations</code>, or it may be empty.</p></li>
<li><p>Press <code>Add Configuration...</code> and select the <code>Daffodil Debug - Launch</code> option.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the <code>launch.json</code> file has been created it will look something like this</p>

<h1 id="apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code-1">Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code</h1>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code is an extension to the Microsoft® Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor which enables Data Format Description Language (DFDL) syntax highlighting, code completion, and the interactive debugging of DFDL Schema parsing operations using <a href="https://daffodil.apache.org/">Apache Daffodil™</a>.</p>
<p>DFDL is a data modeling language used to describe file formats. The DFDL language is a subset of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Schema Definition (XSD). Just as file formats are rich and complex, so is the modeling language to describe them. Developing DFDL Schemas can be challenging, requiring a lot of iterative development, and testing.</p>
<p>The purpose of Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code is to ease the burden on DFDL Schema developers, enabling them to develop high quality, DFDL Schemas, in less time. VS Code is free, open source, cross-platform, well-maintained, extensible, and ubiquitous in the developer community. These attributes align well with the Apache Daffodil™ project and the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code.</p>

<h3 id="dfdl-syntax-highlighting-1">DFDL Syntax Highlighting</h3>
<p>DFDL is rich and complex. Developers using modern code editors expect some degree of built-in language support for the language in which they are developing, and DFDL should be no different. The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides syntax highlighting to improve the readability and context of the text. In addition, the syntax highlighting provides feedback to the developer indicating the structure and code appear syntactically correct.</p>
<h3 id="dfdl-schema-code-completion-1">DFDL Schema Code Completion</h3>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides code completion, also known as “Intellisense”, offering context-aware code segment predictions that can dramatically speed up DFDL Schema development by reducing keyboard input, memorization by the developer, and typos.</p>

<h3 id="daffodil-data-parse-debugger-1">Daffodil Data Parse Debugger</h3>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides a Daffodil Data Parse Debugger which enables the developer to carefully control the execution of Apache Daffodil™ parse operations. Given a DFDL Schema and a target data file, the developer can step through the execution of a parse line by line, or until the parse reaches some developer-defined location, known as a break point, in the DFDL Schema. What is particularly helpful is that the developer can watch the parsed output, known as the “infoset”, as it’s being created by the parser, and see where the parser is parsing in the data file. This enables the developer to quickly discover and correct issues, improving DFDL Schema development and testing cycles.</p>
<h3 id="data-editor-2">Data Editor</h3>
<p><img width="800" src="images/DE-brief.png" alt="Data Editor"></p>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides an integrated data editor. It is akin to a hex editor, but tuned specifically for challenging Daffodil use cases. As an editor designed for Daffodil developers by Daffodil developers, features of the tool will evolve quickly to address the specific needs of the Daffodil community.</p>
<h1 id="prerequisites-2">Prerequisites</h1>
<p>This guide assumes VS Code and a Java Runtime Environment (Java 8 or greater) are installed.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Install VS Code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/goldengate/1212/gg-winux/GDRAD/java.htm#BGBFJHAB">Install Java Runtime 8 or greater</a></li>
<li>On Linux, glibc 2.31 or greater is required</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="installing-the-apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code-1">Installing the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code</h1>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code can be installed using one of two methods.</p>
<h2 id="option-1-install-the-apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code-from-the-visual-studio-code-extension-marketplace-1">Option 1: Install the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code From the Visual Studio Code Extension Marketplace</h2>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code is available in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode">Visual Studio Code Extension Marketplace</a>.</p>
<h2 id="option-2-install-the-latest-.vsix-file-from-the-apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code-release-page-1">Option 2: Install the Latest .Vsix File From the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code Release Page</h2>
<p>The latest <code>.vsix</code> (the file extension used for VS Code extensions) file can also be downloaded from the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code <a href="https://github.com/apache/daffodil-vscode/releases">releases page</a> and installed by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the command-line via <code>code --install-extension &lt;path-to-downloaded-vsix-file&gt;</code>; or</li>
<li>Using the “Extensions: Install from VSIX” command from within VS Code by opening the Command Palette (Mac = Command+Shift+P, Windows/Linux = Ctrl+Shift+P), and typing <code>vsix</code> to bring up the command and pointing it at the downloaded <code>.vsix</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="dfdl-schema-authoring-using-code-completion-1">DFDL Schema Authoring Using Code Completion</h1>
<h2 id="set-the-editor-to-dfdl-mode-1">Set the Editor to “dfdl” mode</h2>
<p>Since DFDL Schema files end with <code>.xsd</code> (XML Schema Definition or XSD), the editor needs to be informed specifically that DFDL mode is desired over the more general XML mode. The mode is selected in the status bar at the bottom of the editor window.</p>
<h2 id="dfdl-schema-authoring-features-1">DFDL Schema Authoring Features</h2>
<p>Auto suggest is triggered using <code>control space</code> or typing the beginning characters of an item. Typing one or more unique characters will further limit the results.</p>
<p>📝 <strong>NOTE:</strong> Intellisense is <em>context aware</em>, so there is no need to begin a block with <code>&lt;</code>, just start typing the tag name and code completion will automatically handle it as appropriate.</p>
<p>Code completion can be used to add a schema block, with just a couple of keystrokes. Code completion can make short work out of completing a DFDL Format Block, offering context-sensitive suggestions attribute values.</p>
<p>The <code>&gt;</code> or <code>/</code> characters are used to close XML tags. Use <code>tab</code> to select an item from the drop down and to exit double quotes.</p>
<p>Code completion supports creating self-defined <code>dfdl:complextypes</code> and <code>dfdl:simpleTypes</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>tab</code> key can be used to complete an auto-complete item within an XML tag. After auto-complete is triggered, typing the initial character or characters will limit the suggestion results. Inside an XML tag a <code>space</code> or <code>carriage return</code> will trigger a list of context sensitive attribute suggestions.</p>
<p>XPath expressions can be code completed.</p>
<h2 id="known-issues-with-code-completion-1">Known Issues With Code Completion</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code uses a clunky method to auto complete curly braces within quotes. It is anticipated that this will be better addressed in the future. The auto complete method blocks suggestions while typing between the beginning quote, opening curly brace and the closing curly brace, ending quote.</li>

<h2 id="debug-configuration-1">Debug Configuration</h2>
<p>Debugging a DFDL Schema needs both the DFDL Schema to use and a data file to parse. Instead of having to select the DFDL Schema and the data file each time from a file picker, a “launch configuration” can be created, which is a JSON description of the debugging session.</p>
<p>To create the launch profile:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Select <code>Run -&gt; Open Configurations</code> from the VS Code menubar. This will load a <code>launch.json</code> file into the editor. There may be existing <code>configurations</code>, or it may be empty.</p></li>
<li><p>Press <code>Add Configuration...</code> and select the <code>Daffodil Debug - Launch</code> option.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the <code>launch.json</code> file has been created it will look something like this</p>

<p>When uploading files to the mailing list, it may be easier to upload a zip file containing a TDML file, the DFDL Schema file, the input data file, and, optionally, the infoset file. Sending this file to the mailing list will allow other users to unpack your zip file and run your test case. It becomes even easier if you have multiple test cases.</p>
<p>To Generate a TDML file, use similar steps for Launching a DFDL Parse Debugging Session: * Open the DFDL Schema file * From inside the file, open the Command Palette (Mac = Command+Shift+P, Windows/Linux = Ctrl+Shift+P) * Once the Command Palette is opened, select the <code>Daffodil Debug: Generate TDML</code> command * From there, you will be asked to provide the input data file, the TDML test case name, the TDML test case description, and the location/name for the TDML file.</p>
<p>Once the Daffodil Parse has finished, an infoset and a TDML file will be created. The TDML file contains relative paths to the DFDL Schema file, input data file, and infoset file. When creating an archive for these files, preserve the directory structure in the archive.</p>
<p>To Append a new test case to an existing TDML file, use similar steps for Generating a TDML file: * Open the DFDL Schema file * From inside the file, open the Command Palette (Mac = Command+Shift+P, Windows/Linux = Ctrl+Shift+P) * Once the Command Palette is opened, select the <code>Daffodil Debug: Append TDML</code> command * From there, you will be asked to provide the input data file, the TDML test case name, the TDML test case description, and the TDML file</p>
<p>Once the Daffodil Parse has finished, an infoset will be created, and a test case will be added to the existing TDML file. The TDML test case name OR description can be shared between test cases, but no two test cases should share TDML test case names and descriptions. To create an archive for a TDML file with multiple test cases, the same guidelines for creating an archive from a TDML file created from a ‘Generate TDML’ operation should be followed. All DFDL schema files, input data files, the TDML file, and, optionally, the infosets should be added to the archive. Additionally, any directory structure should be preserved in the archive to allow for the relative paths in the TDML file to be resolved.</p>
<p>When running a zip archive created from another user, extract the archive into your workspace folder. If there is an infoset in the zip archive that you wish to compare with your infoset, make sure that the infoset from the zip archive is not located at the same place as the default infoset for the Daffodil Parse that will be run when executing a test case from the TDML file. This is because the Daffodil Parse run by executing the TDML test case uses the default location for its infoset and will overwrite anything that already exists there.</p>
<p>To Execute a test case from a TDML file, use the following steps: * Open a DFDL Schema file * From inside the file, open the Command Palette (Mac = Command+Shift+P, Windows/Linux = Ctrl+Shift+P) * Once the Command Palette is opened, select the <code>Daffodil Debug: Execute TDML</code> command * From there, you will be asked to provide the TDML file, TDML test case name, and TDML test case description</p>
<p>A Daffodil Parse will then be launched. The DFDL Schema file and input data file to be used is determined by the selected test case in the TDML file. The infoset that is generated from this parse can optionally be compared to an infoset included in the zip archive the TDML file was extracted from.</p>
<h2 id="sample-tdml-file">Sample TDML File</h2>
<p>A TDML file is comprised of Test Cases. Each test case describes a DFDL parse operation and points to the inputs and outputs of the DFDL parse operation. Inputs - DFDL Schema file and input data file Outputs - Infoset file</p>
<p>Additionally, each Test Case should be uniquely identified by the combination of its name and description. Currently, this is not enforced, and any duplications will never be selectable by the TDML Execute operation.</p>
<p>Below is a Sample TDML file with a single Test Case along with XPath expressions describing where each item can be found inside of a Test Case.</p>

<h2 id="data-editor-3">Data Editor</h2>
<p>This version of the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code includes a new Data Editor. To use the Data Editor, open the VS Code command palette and select <code>Daffodil Debug: Data Editor</code>.</p>
<p><img width="800" src="images/DE-cmd-palette.png"/></p>
<p>A notification message will appear that informs where the Data Editor will write its logs to. If problems happen, check this log file for clues.</p>
<p><img width="400" src="images/DE-log-notification.png"/></p>
<p>Once the extension is connected to the server, the bottom left corner of the Data Editor shows the version of the Ωedit server powering the editor, and the port its connected to. Hovering over the filled circle shows the CPU load average, the memory usage of the server in bytes, the server session count, the server uptime measured in seconds, and the round trip latency measured in milli-seconds.</p>
<p><img width="800" src="images/DE-heartbeat.png"/></p>
<p>After selecting a file to edit, there will be a table with controls at the top of the Data Editor.</p>
<p><img width="800" src="images/DE-top-controls.png"/></p>
<p>The first section of the table is called <code>File Metrics</code> and it contains the path of the file being edited, its initial size in bytes, and the size as the file is being edited. When changes are committed, the <code>Save</code> button will become enabled, allowing the changes to be saved to file.</p>
<p><img width="400" src="images/DE-filemetrics.png"/></p>
<p>The second section of the table is called <code>Search</code>, and it allows for Searching of byte sequences in the given <code>Edit Encoding</code>. If the <code>Edit Encoding</code> can be case-insensitive, a <code>Case Insensitive</code> checkbox will be displayed allowing for that option to be enabled. The found sequences can be examined using the <code>Prev</code> and <code>Next</code> buttons found in this section. Found sequences can also be replaced in the given <code>Edit Encoding</code> by filling in a replacement sequence. Currently <em>all</em> the sequences will be replaced.</p>
<p><img width="800" src="images/DE-search.png"/> <br/> <img width="800" src="images/DE-replace.png"/></p>
<p>The third section of the table is called <code>Settings</code>, and it allows for toggling the <code>Byte Edit Mode</code> from <code>Single</code> to <code>Multiple</code>.</p>
<p>In <code>Single</code> byte edit mode, individual bytes may be <em>deleted</em>, <em>inserted</em> (to the left or to the right of the selected byte), and <em>overwritten</em> in the <code>Ephemeral Edit Window</code> that appears when a byte in the <code>Physical</code> or <code>Logical</code> viewports is clicked. Mouseover the buttons of the <code>Ephemeral Edit Window</code> to determine what each button does. Mouseover the <code>Input Box</code> and it will show the byte offset position in the selected <code>Address Radix</code>. Buttons will become enabled or disabled depending on whether there is valid input in the <code>Input Box</code> or not. Values entered in the <code>Input Box</code> must match the format set by the byte display radix when editing bytes in the <code>Physical</code> viewport or be in Latin-1 (8-bit ASCII) format when editing bytes in the <code>Logical</code> viewport.</p>
<p><img width="800" src="images/DE-SBM.png"/></p>
<p>In <code>Multiple</code> byte edit mode, a segment of bytes is selected from either the <code>Physical</code> or <code>Logical</code> viewports, then the selected segment of bytes is edited in the <code>Edit</code> viewport using the selected <code>Edit Encoding</code>. Once editing of the selected segment is completed, the <code>Commit</code> button is pressed, and the edited segment replaces the selected segment</p>
<p><img width="800" src="images/DE-MBM.png"/></p>
<p>Byte addresses can be expressed in hexadecimal, decimal, or octal. The selected <code>Address Radix</code> is also what is used entering an offset into the <code>Offset</code> input. If an offset was entered in the <code>Offset</code> input and the <code>Address Radix</code> is changed, the offset will automatically be converted into the selected radix.</p>
<p><img width="800" src="images/DE-offset-hex.png"/> <br/> <img width="800" src="images/DE-offset-dec.png"/></p>
<p>In <code>Single</code> byte edit mode, byte editing can be done in the <code>Physical</code> viewport, or the <code>Logical</code> viewport. The <code>Physical</code> viewport shows the bytes as they are stored in the file and can be represented in <code>Hexadecimal</code>, <code>Decimal</code>, <code>Octal</code>, or <code>Binary</code> depending on the <code>Byte Display Radix</code>. The <code>Logical</code> viewport always shows the bytes as <code>Latin-1</code>. The <code>Data View</code> shows the integer and floating point values of the bytes starting at the selected address. The values in the <code>Data View</code> will be expressed in the selected <code>Endianness</code> (<code>Little</code> or <code>Big</code>).</p>
<p><img width="800" src="images/DE-SBM-oct.png"/> <img width="800" src="images/DE-SBM-bin.png"/></p>
<p>In <code>Multiple</code> byte edit mode, byte editing can only be done in the <code>Edit</code> viewport using a selection of bytes from the <code>Physical</code> or <code>Logical</code> viewports. The <code>Edit</code> viewport shows the bytes represented in <code>Hexadecimal</code>, <code>Binary</code>, <code>ASCII</code>, <code>Latin-1</code>, <code>UTF-8</code>, or <code>UTF-16LE</code> (UTF-16 Little Endian), depending on the <code>Edit Encoding</code>. Once the editing of that segment is done, the <code>Commit</code> button is pressed, and the edited segment replaces the selected segment in the <code>Physical</code> and <code>Logical</code> viewports.</p>
<p>Regardless of the <code>Byte Edit Mode</code>, changes can be Undoed and Redone using the <code>Undo</code> and <code>Redo</code> buttons. The <code>Revert All</code> button will revert all changes made to the file since it was opened in the Data Editor.</p>
<p><img width="200" src="images/DE-EditEncoding.png"/> <img width="800" src="images/DE-MBM-UTF-8.png"/></p>
<p>The Data Editor supports light and dark modes. The mode is determined by the VSCode theme. If the VSCode theme is set to a light theme, the Data Editor will be in light mode. If the VSCode theme is set to a dark theme, the Data Editor will be in dark mode.</p>
<p><img width="800" src="images/Theme-selection.png"/> <img width="800" src="images/DE-light-theme.png"/></p>
<h3 id="data-editor-limitations-in-v1.3.0">Data Editor Limitations in v1.3.0</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The current editing limit is 1,000,000 bytes. This is due to the amount of memory it takes to encode and display all the bytes in the viewports.</p></li>
<li><p>Only one Data Editor instance can be opened at one time.</p></li>
<li><p>Viewport selections do not persist when they lose focus. This is a limitation of implementing the display viewports using textarea elements.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently Replace will replace <em>all instances</em> of the given search pattern with the replacement pattern.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As of v1.3.0, this feature is <em>minimally viable</em> and will be improving over time. Expect these limitations to be removed in the next release.</p>

<h1 id="apache-daffodil-extension-for-visual-studio-code-brief">Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code: Brief</h1>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code is an extension to the Microsoft® Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor, designed for Data Format Description Language<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup> (DFDL) Schema developers. The purpose of the Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code is to ease the burden on DFDL Schema developers by enabling rapid development of high-quality DFDL Schemas, with syntax highlighting, code completion, data file editing, and debugging of DFDL Schema parsing operations using Apache Daffodil™.</p>
<h2 id="dfdl-schema-development">DFDL Schema Development</h2>
<p><img width="800" src="images/schema-dev.png"/></p>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides syntax highlighting to improve the readability and context of the text and provide instant feedback to the developer indicating the structure and code are syntactically correct.</p>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides code completion offering context-aware code segment predictions that can dramatically speed up DFDL Schema development by reducing keyboard input, memorization by the developer, and typos.</p>
<h2 id="daffodil-data-parse-debugger-2">Daffodil Data Parse Debugger</h2>
<p><img width="800" src="images/data-parse-debugger.png"/></p>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio provides a Daffodil parse debugger enabling the developer to control the execution of Daffodil parse operations. Given a DFDL Schema and a target data file, the developer can step through the execution of parse operations line by line, or until the parse reaches some developer-defined location, known as a breakpoint, in the DFDL Schema or the data being parsed. What is particularly helpful is that the developer can watch the parsed output, known as the “Infoset”, as it is being created by the parser, and watch where the parser is parsing in the data file. This enables the developer to quickly discover and correct DFDL Schema issues, making development and testing cycles more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="data-editor-4">Data Editor</h2>
<p>The Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code provides an integrated data editor that is tuned specifically for challenging Daffodil use cases. It is designed to support large files, of any type, that are well beyond the limits of the standard text editor in VS Code. The Data Editor allows for setting Data Parse Debugger breakpoints on offset positions in the data file. The Data Editor handles non-standard byte sizes, non-aligned bytes, and byte ordering where the Least Significant Byte (LSB) can be the first or last bit in a byte. Features of the Data Editor will evolve to address the specific needs of the Daffodil community.</p>
<h1 id="getting-help-2">Getting Help</h1>
<p>If additional help or guidance on using Apache Daffodil™, Apache Daffodil™ Extension for Visual Studio Code, or DFDL development in general is needed, please engage with the Daffodil user and developer communities on <a href="https://daffodil.apache.org/community/">mailing lists</a> (https://daffodil.apache.org/community/) and/or review the <a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?users@daffodil.apache.org">list archives</a> (https://lists.apache.org/list.html?users@daffodil.apache.org).</p>
