This is a [Giter8](https://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) template to be 
used with the [SBT build tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) to generate a 
starting directory tree, file, and build tool layout for a new DFDL Schema project using the 
[Standard DFDL Schema Project Layout](/dfdl-layout).

See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/apache/daffodil-schema.g8) for details
on how to run the template.
