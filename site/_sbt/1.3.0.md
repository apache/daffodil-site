# New Features

* The default value of the `daffodilVersion` setting is updated to `3.10.0`
* The new `daffodil-junit-tdml` jar added in Daffodil 3.10.0 is now added to the `test` classpath. DFDL projects with `daffodilVersion` 3.2.0 or newer can now use the more compact TDML JUnit API
* The `packageDaffodilBin` task now outputs Daffodil logs. The log level can be controlled by the `packageDaffodilBin/logLevel` setting
* The sbt command `export packageDaffodilBin` now outputs commands and arguments used to build saved parsers. This can be copied into a CLI, script, IDE, etc. to build saved parsers outside of SBT
