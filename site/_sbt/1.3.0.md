This is a minor release of the Apache Daffodil SBT Plugin.

See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/apache/daffodil-sbt) for details to enable and configure.

#### New Features

* The default value of the `daffodilVersion` setting is updated to `3.10.0`
* The new `daffodil-junit-tdml` jar added in Daffodil 3.10.0 is now added to the `test` classpath. DFDL projects with `daffodilVersion` 3.2.0 or newer can now use the more compact TDML JUnit API
* The `packageDaffodilBin` task now outputs Daffodil logs. The log level can be controlled by the `packageDaffodilBin/logLevel` setting
