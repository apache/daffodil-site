This is a minor release of the Apache Daffodil SBT Plugin.

See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/apache/daffodil-sbt) for details to enable and configure.

#### New Features

* The default value of the `daffodilVersion` setting is updated to `3.11.0`
* Add support for Scala 2.13 and Scala 3

#### Deprecation/Compatibility

* SBT 1.9+ is now required to use this plugin
* daffodil-sbt does not support building against multiple versions of Daffodil
  that require different major versions of Scala simultaneously. For example:
  `daffodilPackageBinVersions := Seq("3.10.0", "3.11.0")`
  is not supported as Daffodil 3.10.0 requires Scala 2.12 and Daffodil 3.11.0
  requires Scala 2.13. Building them separately or in different SBT subprojects
  with the appropriate changes to `daffodilVersion` and
  `daffodilPackageBinVersions` is supported, assuming all Scala based
  test/plugin/layer code is cross compatible between Scala 2.12 and 2.13.
  See [Daffodil 3.11.0 and Scala 2.13 Transition](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DAFFODIL/Daffodil+3.11.0+and+Scala+2.13+Transition)
