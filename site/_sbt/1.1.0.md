This is a minor release of the Apache Daffodil SBT Plugin.

See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/apache/daffodil-sbt) for details to enable and configure.

# New Features

* Default `daffodilVersion` is updated to 3.8.0
* `scalaVersion` is now set automatically based on Java version and `daffodilVersion`. It is recommended that SBT configurations no longer set `scalaVersion`
* New `daffodilBuildsCharset` setting, automatically adds Daffodil dependencies required to build custom character sets
* Modify `daffodilPackageBinInfos` syntax to support future capabilities. Old syntax is still supported but should be updated
* Add configuration file option to `daffodilPackageBinInfos`, useful to specify tunables like suppress schema compilation warnings
* Support `daffodilPackageBinInfos` main schema defined in a dependency jar

# Bug Fixes

* `daffodilTdmlUsesPackageBin` now works in IntelliJ
* Fix `NullPointerException` if a schema file cannot be found when running `packageDaffodilBin`
