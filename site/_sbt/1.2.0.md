This is a minor release of the Apache Daffodil SBT Plugin.

See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/apache/daffodil-sbt) for details to enable and configure.

#### New Features

* The default `daffodilVersion` value is updated to 3.9.0
* The `packageDaffodilBin/publishArtifact` setting can now be used to disable publishing saved parsers created with `packageDaffodilBin`
* The `packageDaffodilBin` task now creates depersonalized saved parsers
* New warning when `packageDaffodilBin` will not create any artifacts
* New warning when `daffodilFlatLayout` is true but the layout does not look flat
* New warning when `DaffodilBinInfo` schema path does not start with a `/`
* Improve `DaffodilBinInfo` documentation

#### Deprecation/Compatibility

* The `DAFFODIL_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable is no longer used.
  Instead, set the `packageDaffodilBin/javaOptions` setting, which allow specific per project settings.
  See documentation for examples.
* Projects that create layers, character sets, or UDF plugins no longer add Daffodil jars as a transitive dependency.
  Projects using this plugin will see no difference, since Daffodil dependencies are defined via the `daffodilVersion` setting
