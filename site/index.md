The [Data Format Description Language (DFDL)](https://www.ogf.org/ogf/doku.php/standards/dfdl/dfdl)
is a specification, developed by the [Open Grid Forum](https://www.ogf.org/),
capable of describing many data formats, including both textual and binary,
scientific and numeric, legacy and modern, commercial record-oriented, and many
industry and military standards. It defines a language that is a subset of W3C
XML schema to describe the logical format of the data, and annotations within
the schema to describe the physical representation.

Daffodil is an open source implementation of the DFDL specification that uses
these DFDL schemas to parse fixed format data into an infoset, which is most
commonly represented as either XML or JSON. This allows the use of
well-established XML or JSON technologies and libraries to consume, inspect,
and manipulate fixed format data in existing solutions. Daffodil is also
capable of the reverse by serializing or "unparsing" an XML or JSON infoset
back to the original data format.
