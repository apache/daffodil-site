This release contains a VS Code extension for debugging Daffodil schemas inside of VS Code.

#### New Features

* DFDL schema debugging
* Output infoset to console, file or none
* Scala implementation of the daffodil debugger
* Infoset View
    * This view dynamically updates to show the user what the current state of the infoset looks like
* Infoset Diff View
    * This view dynamically updates to show the user the difference of the infoset from the previous step to the current one
* Hex View
    * This view displays to the user the hexadeciaml of their data file
    * This view also highlights the current byte of the data file being read
* Session launch configuration:
    * Both options are done utilizing file called `.vscode/launch.json`. This file can hold multiple different debugging profiles that can be selected between in VS Code
    * Configuration via Launch wizard:
        * The launch wizard is an interactive GUI that helps user set the values they want for the debugging configuration
        * The launch wizard allows for creating the 1st debug profile, creating additional debug profiles and updating existing debug profiles.
        * If the profile created is the first one the file `.vscode/launch.json` is automatically created with the profile in it
        * If the profile is an additional profile it will be appended to the list at `.vscode/launch.json`
        * If the profile already exists in `.vscode/launch.json`, the profile in the file will be updated upon saving
    * via Manual Editing:
        * The other way to customized the launch configuration is by manually editing the `.vscode/launch.json` file.
        * This is done by editing the specific profile you wish to change. This allows easy changing of the schema file, data file and other settings.
* Run currently opened schema file
* Debug currently opened schema file
* Daffodil toolbar and Command Palette:
    * Open Infoset View
    * Open Infoset Diff View
    * Open Hex View
    * Open Launch Wizard
    * NOTE: These commands only become available when debugging has been started
* Set breakpoints inside of main schema file
* Set breakpoints inside of imported schemas
