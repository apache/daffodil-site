#### Core

* support for unparse, with one-to-one feature parity with parse
* support for unparse specific properties like dfdl:outputValueCalc, dfdl:filleByte, dfdl:truncateSpecifiedLengthString
* now requires Java 8 and Scala 2.11
* DFDL expression changes:
	* support added for dfdl:contentLength(), dfdl:valueLength(), fn:error(), and math:pow() functions
	* support equality comparisons of xs:hexBinary types
	* fix bugs with integer equality comparisons and converting differing integer types
	* fix bugs with div/idiv not using the appropriate kindof division
	* fix bugs with daf:trace on complex types
* creation of a new data input/output stream layer
* add support for 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-bit ASCII encodings
* add property daf:parseUnparsePolicy and tunable to enable only parsing, unparsing, or both
* add tunable unqualifiedPathStepProperty to specify how unqualified DFDL expression path steps are resolved
* allow dfdl:lengthKind="pattern" when type="xs:hexBinary"
* support for xs:choice direct dispatch
* support for xs:boolean type
* support for xs:hexBinary type with bit lengths
* support for xs:ignoreCase="yes"
* support for xs:union restrictions
* support for runtime valued properties
* improved diagnostic messages
* numerous bug fixes and performance improvements
* fix failure to import/include schemas with deep paths. includes and imports now reliably import files in jars or relative to paths on the classpath

#### API

* new parse and unparse API with InfosetInputter's and InfosetOutputter's
* native infoset support for JDOM, w3c DOM, Scala XML Nodes, XML Text, and JSON
* calling isError on a ParseResult now returns true if either there were parse errors OR validation errors
* add new methods (isProcessingError and isValidationError) to ParseResult to determine if isError was true due to a parse error or a validation error
* deprecated the canProceed() method, instead one should use !isError()

#### TDML

* support for setting tunables in tdml:defineConfig
* created an XSL stylesheet for creating DFDL tutorials from TDML files
