#### TDML Runner Cross Validation

It is now possible to use the TDML runner with tests with different DFDL implementations, including
the IBM DFDL implementation. DFDL implementations must create a class named
``TDMLDFDLProcessorFactory`` and implement the abstract functions. A new ``implementation``
attribute is added to the ``tdml:parserTestCase`` and ``tdml:unparserTestCase`` elements to define
which tests an implementation is known to work with.

* {% jira 723 %} Compatibility: Cross Validation test rig for DFDL and IBM implementation
* {% jira 2032 %} Improve Eclipse setup for cross testing

New in the TDML runner is type-aware infoset comparisons. One can now provide an ``xsi:type``
attribute in infoset elements, allowing the TDML runner to determine if two elements are logically
the same even if there infoset values may differ.

* {% jira 2026 %} TDML Runner - type-sensitive comparison

#### Prefixed Length Kind

Support is added for ``dfdl:lengthKind="prefixed"`` and the properties
``dfdl:prefixIncludesPrefixLength`` and ``dfdl:prefixLengthType``.

* {% jira 114 %} LengthKind Prefixed
* {% jira 2035 %} prefixLengthType and element lengthUnits only needs to be the same when prefixIncludePrefixLength

#### Deprecation/Compatibility

The following changes have been made which affect compatibility with past releases:

Infoset elements with type ``xs:dateTime`` and ``xs:time`` no longer contain
milliseconds precision if the milliseconds value is 0.

* {% jira 2005 %} dateTime types without milliseconds precision should not output .000000

Previous versions of Daffodil automatically coerced the result of a DFDL expression to the expected
type if they differed. This is incorrect behavior according to the DFDL specification, and now
results in a warning when such coercion is required. Instead, expressions must explicitly cast the
result type to the expected type. This auto-coercion + warning behavior is deprecated and will
change to a schema definition error in a future release.

* {% jira 2021 %} Daffodil expressions for properties should not auto-coerce to property type. Test BC000.
* {% jira 1044 %} DPath not finding obvious type errors involving constants at compile time
* {% jira 2054 %} Change coerecion errors to warnings and eventually deprecate

Elements with a type of ``xs:hexBinary`` now ignore the ``dfdl:byteOrder`` property and always parse
data as if it were ``bigEndian``. The result is that hexBinary bytes where
``dfdl:byteOrder="littleEndian"`` now appear reversed when compared to previous releases.

* {% jira 2019 %} daf extension property to turn on/off "hexBinary with bits" lengthUnits behavior

Official support for Java 7 has been removed.

* {% jira 2025 %} Remove OracleJDK7 from TravisCI

#### IBM DFDL Compatibility

Other changes and bug fixes specifically made to improve IBM DFDL compatibility:

* {% jira   20 %} obtain and integrate/run IBM test cases (even if they all break)
* {% jira  559 %} TDML runner needs feature to tolerate left-over data for IBM test compatibilitiy

* {% jira 1988 %} textOutputMinLength - incorrect code found by inspection
* {% jira 1989 %} lengthKind 'explicit' with expression should not use minLength nor textOutputMinLength
* {% jira 2006 %} DFDLGeneralFormat missing binaryCalendarEpoch.
* {% jira 2015 %} Accept textStandardExponentCharacter (Old property name)
* {% jira 2017 %} Non-portable date/time test\_simple\_type\_properties\_text\_calendar\_13\_02
* {% jira 2031 %} Type with xs:hexBinary requires the dfdl:binaryNumberRep property
* {% jira 2033 %} dfdl:defineVariable defaultType does not properly convert value
* {% jira 2063 %} DPath: long div long results in double. Should be decimal.

#### Improved Windows Support

Tests are updated to be compatible with Windows. A new MSI installer is now
made available for releases.

* {% jira 2047 %} Create Windows MSI Installer
* {% jira 2051 %} Many tests are OS-dependent and fail on Windows platform
* {% jira 2058 %} Some CLI tests do not work cleanly on the Windows platform.
