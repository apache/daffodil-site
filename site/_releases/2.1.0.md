Daffodil 2.1.0 is the first release of Daffodil as an Apache incubator project.
This release includes relicensing the source to Apache v2, changing the
namespace to org.apache.daffodil, and numerous bug fixes and DFDL feature
additions to support more DFDL schemas.

**This release contains changes which break compatibility with past releases.**
Please see the deprecation / compatibility notes section for more information.

#### Packed Decimal

Added support for binary packed decimal data types. In addition to ``standard``,
the ``dfdl:binaryNumberRep`` property now also accepts values of ``bcd``,
``packed``, and ``ibm4690Packed`` to support Binary Coded Decimal, IBM 390
Packed Decimal, and IBM 4690 Packed Decimal, respectively. The
``dfdl:binaryDecimalVirtualPoint`` property applies for the appropriate types.
Also implemented are ``dfdl:binaryPackedSignCodes`` and
``dfdl:binaryNumberCheckPolicy`` to configure the valid nibble values when
``dfdl:binaryNumberRep`` is ``packed``.

* {% jira 1739 %} Implement 'packed' and 'bcd'

#### Apache Incubation Support

Multiple changes were made to support the move to Apache incubation. This
includes changes to the source directory structure, relicensing files to Apache
v2, changing the project package to org.apache.daffodil, updating the build
infrastructure to SBT 1.x, and adding TravisCI continuous integration support.

* {% jira 1856 %} Changes necessary for apache incubation
* {% jira 1857 %} Update sbt to 1.x, simplifing build config and replacing deprecated syntax
* {% jira 1870 %} invalid and nonfunctional URLs in source files
* {% jira 1858 %} Add support for TravisCI
* {% jira 1873 %} sbt warnings/errors 
* {% jira 1612 %} sbt - branches without tags cause sbt compile to fail

#### Ambiguous Path Expressions

Previously, ambiguous path expressions (i.e. path expressions that could
potentially reference multiple non-array elements of the same name) were not
allowed and caused a schema definition error at schema. As of 2.1.0, such
ambiguities are detected at runtime but are now only considered schema
definition warnings. However, if a path expression ever evaluates to more than
on non-array element at runtime, it will then be considered an error and cause a
runtime schema definition error. This can allow for schemas that have ambiguous
path expression, but in practice only ever evaluate to a single element.

* {% jira 1773 %} Choice ambiguous element name results in failed expression
* {% jira 1869 %} Nato link16 doesn't work on 2.0.0 Daffodil
* {% jira 1877 %} Slow schema compilation due to unambiguous checks
* {% jira 1854 %} Remove concept of slots from InfosetImpl.scala
* {% jira 1860 %} Minimize the number of HashMap allocations/insertions in the Infoset

#### TDML Runner Enhancements

Changes were made to the TDML runner to support embedded defaultConfig option
and to verify expected schema definition warnings.

* {% jira 1868 %} TDML Runner defaultConfig cannot be embedded. Not checked properly.
* {% jira 1583 %} TDML Runner - expected warnings feature
* {% jira 1846 %} TDML Runner - Infoset.contents is stripping off all attributes

#### BitOrder/ByteOrder/Encoding Refactoring

* {% jira 1001 %} Invalid bitOrder and byteOrder combination should produce SDE
* {% jira 1597 %} Too many ways that encoding, byteOrder, etc. are being setup
* {% jira 1843 %} Unparser bitOrder change and OVC (outputValueCalc) interaction
* {% jira 1876 %} Improve performance regression due to FormatInfo changes

#### XML Output

The XML infoset output (via the XMLTextInfosetOutputter) now writes an XML
declaration ``<?xml version="1.) ... ?>`` at the beginning of output. It also
ensures output is flushed at the end of writing, which should prevent issues
users reported of receiving only partial data.

* {% jira 1844 %} XMLTextInfosetOutputter should output an XML declaration
* {% jira 1871 %} XMLTextInfosetOutputter endDocument should flush the writer

#### Miscellaneous Bug Fixes

* {% jira 1867 %} Memory leak in Register
* {% jira 1862 %} Better logging/reset mechanism for MarkPool
* {% jira 1851 %} Unparsing delimited data with escape characters could lead to truncation
* {% jira 1855 %} Property Resolution - resolve onto ref objects
* {% jira 1864 %} spurious SDE about all-text schema being non-scannable
* {% jira 1866 %} Eclipse classpaths need fixing
* {% jira 1872 %} Eclipse classpaths for daffodil-io module need fixing

#### Deprecation/Compatability

As of 2.1.0, the following changes have been made which affect compatibility
with past releases:

**Namespace Change**

Now that Daffodil is an Apache incubator project, its package namespace has been
changed from ``edu.illinois.ncsa.daffodil`` to ``org.apache.daffodil``.
Developers using the Daffodil Java and Scala API will need to update their
source code and SBT/Maven configurations to use the new package namespace.

**Daffodil Extension ``daf`` XML Namespace Change**

The Daffodil extension ``daf`` XML namespace has been modified to represent the move to
Apache, changing from ``urn:ogf:dfdl:2013:imp:opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu:2012:ext``
to ``urn:ogf:dfdl:2013:imp:daffodil.apache.org:2018:ext``. Backwards
compatibility is maintained for schemas using the old ``daf`` namespace. All future
Daffodil extensions will only be supported in the new namespace, so it is
recommended that one update schemas to use the new namespace.
