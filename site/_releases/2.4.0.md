#### Explicit Length Choices

Support is added for the property ``dfdl:choiceLengthKind="explicit"`` and
``dfdl:choiceLength``. Previously, Daffodil ignored the ``choiceLengthKind``
property, always acting as if it had the value of ``implicit``. The property is
now required to be defined in scope for all choices.

* {% jira 640 %} choiceLengthKind='explicit'

#### Extension Namespace

A new ``dfdlx`` namespace (``http://www.ogf.org/dfdl/dfdl-1.0/extensions``) was
created to support Daffodil extensions to the DFDL specification. The existing
``daf`` namespace is deprecated and all uses should be switched to ``dfdlx``.
Some properties, such as the layering extension properties are also moved to
this namespace with backwards compatibility supported for now. Extensions
should be considered experimental--support may change or be removed in a
future release.

* {% jira 2096 %} Add dfdlx extensions namespace prefix. Convert existing extensions to this namespace.

#### Extension: Empty Element Parse Policy [[Proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DAFFODIL/Proposal%3A+dfdlx%3AemptyElementParsePolicy+Property)]

A new DFDL property named ``dfdlx:emptyElementParsePolicy`` is added to
control the behavior of empty string and hexBinary elements. This property
allows one to switch between different behaviors for empty elements which
correspond to currently described behavior in the DFDL v1.0 specification
document, and an alternate behavior planned for future inclusion in the DFDL
v1.0 specification which also increase compatibility with IBM DFDL.

* {% jira 110 %} Implement separator suppression policies
* {% jira 1080 %} RepUnbounded Error: Sequence of Optional Comma-separated String items
* {% jira 1400 %} broken test: test_text_entities_6_03b - separators with different encoding than terms they separate
* {% jira 1919 %} Trailing Separator Suppression
* {% jira 1975 %} Incorrect separator behavior - missing separator for empty sequence (non-backward compatible)
* {% jira 1976 %} Incorrect creation of empty-string element
* {% jira 2134 %} emptyElementParsePolicyError not accepted as warning ID in TDML define config.
* {% jira 2135 %} Array index not maintained properly. Causes nillable failures among others.
* {% jira 2143 %} dfdl:initiatedContent="yes" on sequence should only affect optional children
* {% jira 2154 %} nilled element of zero length inside optional complex element is deleted
* {% jira 2162 %} direct dispatch choice that has an array branch causes abort during compilation

#### Extension: Enumeration Values [[Proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DAFFODIL/Proposal%3A+Feature+to+support+enumerations+and+typeValueCalc)]

New DFDL properties and functions are added to support translation of
enumeration values.

* {% jira 2107 %} Implement Enum Support
* {% jira 2146 %} Incorrectly recognize keyset-value transform as identity transfrom
* {% jira 2148 %} No compile time error when using nonexistent TypeCalc function
* {% jira 2165 %} Add \*Double functions to the typeCalc family of functions

#### Extension: Ranged Direct Dispatch [[Proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DAFFODIL/Proposal%3A+choiceBranchKeyRanges)]

A new property named ``dfdlx:choiceBranchKeyRanges`` is added to support direct
dispatch based on a range of numeric values.

* {% jira 2157 %} Implement choiceBranchKeyRanges

#### Extension: Lookahead Expression Function [[Proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DAFFODIL/Proposal%3A+DFDLX+lookAhead)]

A new DFDL expression function named ``dfdlx:lookAhead()`` is added to support a
simple way to consider data that occurs at a future point in the bitstream.

* {% jira 2140 %} Implement dfdl:lookAhead()

#### Improved DFDL Schema Validation

Daffodil now does a better job at validating attribute-, short-, and
element-form DFDL properties, which will now result in an error if unknown
properties are used, mostly commonly caused by typos. Additionally, if DFDL
properties are ignored (e.g. ``dfdl:textPattern`` is provided when
``dfdl:lengthKind`` is not "pattern"), Daffodil will now provide a warning.

* {% jira 598 %} No validation of short-form DFDL properties
* {% jira 1619 %} Warn of when dfdl annotations are ignored
* {% jira 2142 %} DFDL annotation on complex type is silently ignored
* {% jira 2150 %} Excessive emptyElementParsePolicy warnings
* {% jira 2163 %} False warning about unused dfdl:choiceBranchKey on direct dispatch array

#### Deprecation/Compatibility

The following changes have been made which affect compatibility with past releases:

* The behavior of separators has been revised to better conform to the DFDL
  specification, which enables more DFDL schemas to work without Daffodil
  specific modifications. Schemas that relied on the previous non-comformant
  behavior may require changes.
* The ``dfdl:choiceLengthKind`` property must now be defined in scope of all
  ``xs:choice``'s. Allowed values are either ``implicit`` or ``explicit``. The
  previous behavior always treated the property as if it had the value of
  ``implicit``.
* The ``daf`` namespace has been deprecated and replaced with the ``dfdlx``
  namespace. Some properties were also moved to the new ``dfdlx`` namespace.
  The following properties/functions should be updated to use the new
  namespace, with backwards compatibility supported for now:
  * dfdl:layerTransform
  * dfdl:layerEncoding
  * dfdl:layerLengthKind
  * dfdl:layerLength
  * dfdl:layerLengthUnits
  * dfdl:layerBoundaryMark
  * daf:parseUnparsePolicy
  * daf:trace()
  * daf:error()

#### DFDL Schema Compatibility

Many changes and bug fixes specifically made to improve compatibility with more
DFDL schemas. With these fixes and features, the schemas
[HL7-v2.7](https://github.com/DFDLSchemas/HL7-v2.7),
[IBM4690-TLOG](https://github.com/DFDLSchemas/IBM4690-TLOG), and
[EDIFACT](https://github.com/DFDLSchemas/EDIFACT)
now work with Daffodil.
