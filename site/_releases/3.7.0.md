* {% jira 2885 %} Release Daffodil 3.7.0

#### Deprecation/Compatibility

* The deprecated separatorPolicy property values of "suppressedAtEndLax"
  and "suppressedAtEndStrict" had incorrect behaviors, with each property
  behaving like the other. Schemas using one value should be updated to
  use the other. Alternatively, schemas should be updated to use the new
  separatorSuppressionPolicy property with the following mappings from the
  deprecated property:
   
  * required -> never
  * suppressed -> anyEmpty
  * suppressedAtEndLax -> trailingEmpty
  * suppressedAtEndStrict -> trailingEmptyStrict
  
  {% jira 2882 %}

* The pad character in the negative part of textNumberPattern is no longer
  ignored if the positive part of textNumberPattern defines a pad
  character without an associated affix (e.g. "*0###0;-*00"). In these
  cases, the position of the pad character in the negative part is used to
  define whether padding occurs before or after the negative affix. All
  other cases follow existing rules of textNumberPattern (i.e. the pad
  character in the negative part is ignored).
  
  {% jira 2871 %}

* The InfosetOutputter trait methods have changed signatures.
  
  The types of the arguments have been replaced:
  
  * DIArray -> InfosetArray
  * DISimple -> InfosetSimpleElement
  * DIComplex -> InfosetComplexElement
  
  This was done to hide the "DIxxx" types as they are
  internal and subject to change.
  
  Methods of DISimple that were named for implementation types (like
  getBigInt, getBigDecimal, etc.) have been replaced by methods named
  for the DFDL types.
  
  These methods are replaced:
  
  * getBigDecimal -> getDecimal
  * getBigInt -> getInteger
  
  These methods also changed names:
  
  * dataValueAsString -> getText
  
  This method is new:
  
  * getNonNegativeInteger
  
  Some methods have been removed (getStatus).
