#### EXI Support

The Daffodil CLI adds two new infoset types--`-I exi` and `-I exisa`--to
support infosets represented as EXI binary XML for non-schema aware and schema
aware EXI, respectively. EXI infosets are significantly smaller in size than
normal XML infosets, and are often even smaller than the original data format
when made schema aware. This support has been enabled with the
[Exificient](https://exificient.github.io/) library.

API users can create EXI files using the existing `SAXInfosetInputter` and
`SAXInfosetOutputter` classes and the Exificient SAX API. This has also been
tested with the Agile Delta EXI SAX API. Schema aware EXI can be enabled using
the `DaffodilXMLEntityResolver`, newly added to Java and Scala public APIs.

* {% jira 1959 %} EXIficient Inputter and outputter for XML EXI representation
* {% jira 2739 %} Expose DFDLCatalogResolver to the public API

#### Pluggable Character Sets

Custom character sets can now be added to Daffodil by implementing a custom
`BitsCharsetDefinition` class and related functions/classes, listing it in a
`META-INF/services` file, packaging it into a jar, and adding it to the
Daffodil classpath.

* {% jira 2663 %} charset encoders need to be pluggable (doc needed)

#### Embedded XML in the Infoset

When using the `XMLTextInfosetInputter` and `XMLTextInfosetOutputter` in the
API, or `-I xml` in the CLI, simple string elements with the DFDL extension
attribute of `dfdl:runtimeProperties="stringAsXml=true"` are treated as XML.
This means that when parsing, instead of outputting the content as an XML
escaped string, the parsed content is checked to be valid XML and output as if
it were part of the XML infoset. When unparsing, the XML part of the infoset is
converted back to a string. Note that because there are multiple ways to read
and write XML that are syntactically different but semantically the same, it is
possible that parsed or unparsed data may differ from the original data.

* {% jira 2708 %} XML String feature in XML Text Infoset Inputter/Outputter

#### C Code Generator (Runtime2) Updates

The C code generator backend now supports reading and writing N-bit booleans
and integers, where N is an explicit length from 1 to 64 bits. Additional
miscellaneous changes include unit test support, fixes to nested choices, and
tweaks to how float numbers are output.

* {% jira 2696 %} Extend runtime2 to N-bit booleans and integers (1 <= N <= 64)

#### Additional New Features/Improvements

* {% jira 2357 %} Update recoverable error to not be an SDW
* {% jira 2369 %} TDML language needs comment syntax in documentPart byte and bits
* {% jira 2685 %} Upgrade Scala XML library to 2.1.0 version
* {% jira 2697 %} Choose TDML implementation to run TDML tests
* {% jira 2702 %} Eliminate build warning on VSCode scala build of Daffodil
* {% jira 2719 %} Add tests to illustrate some nillable and fixed-length scenarios
* {% jira 2723 %} Change DataProcessor.copy() method to public
* {% jira 2725 %} TDML runner needs to support pre-compiled DFDL schema

#### Miscellaneous Bug Fixes

* {% jira 2237 %} XML comment not allowed inside dfdl:defineEscapeScheme
* {% jira 2488 %} When executing a parse command with the debugger get incorrect result for display info unparser
* {% jira 2616 %} End-user doc of how import/include schemaLocation resolver works
* {% jira 2654 %} java.util.NoSuchElementException: head of empty list on commented out includes/choice branches
* {% jira 2680 %} Add new transitive deps' NOTICE to Daffodil's bin.NOTICE
* {% jira 2682 %} Update copyrights to 2022
* {% jira 2693 %} Add Adam Rosien to https://daffodil.apache.org/people/
* {% jira 2701 %} Facet checks throw exception for non-numeric float/double values
* {% jira 2704 %} sbt tests are intermittenly hanging
* {% jira 2710 %} build.md instructions fail for RedHat - no mxml-devel
* {% jira 2713 %} Release candidate container has poor cacability and reproducability
* {% jira 2717 %} unparser deadlocks in mil-std-2045 2-message file case
* {% jira 2726 %} Index out of bounds -1 during unparsing

#### Deprecation/Compatibility

* `dfdl:assert`'s with `failureType="recoverableError"` are now reported as
  validation errors instead of schema definition warnings {% jira 2357 %}

* All `InfosetInputter` and `InfosetOutputter` functions now return `Unit`
  instead of `Boolean`. Errors are now expected to be thrown as exceptions
  {% jira 2721 %}
