#### EXI Support

The Daffodil CLI adds two new infoset types--`-I exi` and `-I exisa`--to
support infosets represented as EXI binary XML for non-schema aware and schema
aware EXI, respectively. EXI infosets are significantly smaller in size than
normal XML infosets, and are often even smaller than the original data format
when made schema aware. The Daffodil CLI has added the
[Exificient](https://exificient.github.io/) library to support these infoset
types.

API users can create EXI files by combining the existing `SAXInfosetInputter`
and `SAXInfosetOutputter` classes with the Exificient SAX API or they can use
the Agile Delta EXI SAX API which has been tested with Daffodil as
well. Daffodil has added the new `DaffodilXMLEntityResolver` class to its
Java and Scala public APIs to support creating schema aware EXI files too.

* {% jira 1959 %} EXIficient Inputter and outputter for XML EXI representation
* {% jira 2739 %} Expose DFDLCatalogResolver to the public API

#### Pluggable Character Sets

Custom character sets can now be added to Daffodil by implementing a custom
`BitsCharsetDefinition` class and related functions/classes, listing it in a
`META-INF/services` file, packaging it into a jar, and adding it to the
Daffodil classpath.

* {% jira 2663 %} charset encoders need to be pluggable (doc needed)

#### Embedded XML in the Infoset

When using the `XMLTextInfosetInputter` and `XMLTextInfosetOutputter` classes
in the API, or `-I xml` in the CLI, simple string elements with the DFDL
extension attribute `dfdlx:runtimeProperties="stringAsXml=true"` are treated as
XML. This means that when parsing, instead of outputting the content as an XML
escaped string, the parsed content is checked to be valid XML and output as if
it were part of the XML infoset. When unparsing, the embedded XML part of the
infoset is converted back to a string. Note that because there are multiple
ways to read and write XML that are syntactically different but semantically
the same, it is possible that parsed or unparsed data may differ from the
original data.

* {% jira 2708 %} XML String feature in XML Text Infoset Inputter/Outputter

#### C Code Generator (Runtime2) Updates

The C code generator backend now supports reading and writing N-bit booleans
and integers, where N is an explicit length from 1 to 64 bits. Additional
miscellaneous changes include unit test support, fixes to nested choices,
tweaks to how float numbers are output, and a command line option to choose the
TDML implementation to run TDML tests.

* {% jira 2696 %} Extend runtime2 to N-bit booleans and integers (1 <= N <= 64)
* {% jira 2697 %} Choose TDML implementation to run TDML tests

#### Additional New Features/Improvements

* {% jira 2357 %} Update recoverable error to not be an SDW
* {% jira 2369 %} TDML language needs comment syntax in documentPart byte and bits
* {% jira 2685 %} Upgrade Scala XML library to 2.1.0 version
* {% jira 2702 %} Eliminate build warning on VSCode scala build of Daffodil
* {% jira 2719 %} Add tests to illustrate some nillable and fixed-length scenarios
* {% jira 2723 %} Change DataProcessor.copy() method to public
* {% jira 2725 %} TDML runner needs to support pre-compiled DFDL schema

#### Miscellaneous Bug Fixes

* {% jira 2237 %} XML comment not allowed inside dfdl:defineEscapeScheme
* {% jira 2488 %} When executing a parse command with the debugger get incorrect result for display info unparser
* {% jira 2616 %} End-user doc of how import/include schemaLocation resolver works
* {% jira 2654 %} java.util.NoSuchElementException: head of empty list on commented out includes/choice branches
* {% jira 2680 %} Add new transitive deps' NOTICE to Daffodil's bin.NOTICE
* {% jira 2682 %} Update copyrights to 2022
* {% jira 2693 %} Add Adam Rosien to https://daffodil.apache.org/people/
* {% jira 2701 %} Facet checks throw exception for non-numeric float/double values
* {% jira 2704 %} sbt tests are intermittenly hanging
* {% jira 2710 %} build.md instructions fail for RedHat - no mxml-devel
* {% jira 2713 %} Release candidate container has poor cacability and reproducability
* {% jira 2717 %} unparser deadlocks in mil-std-2045 2-message file case
* {% jira 2726 %} Index out of bounds -1 during unparsing
* {% jira 2742 %} bin.LICENSE and bin.NOTICE need to be updated

#### Deprecation/Compatibility

* `dfdl:assert`'s with `failureType="recoverableError"` are now reported as
  validation errors instead of schema definition warnings {% jira 2357 %}

* All `InfosetInputter` and `InfosetOutputter` functions now return `Unit`
  instead of `Boolean`. Errors are now expected to be thrown as exceptions
  {% jira 2721 %}
